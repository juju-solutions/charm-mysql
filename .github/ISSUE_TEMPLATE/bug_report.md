# Deprecation Notice

This repo is home to a hook-based charm from a simpler time. It remains for historical purposes.

Source for the currently supported [mysql charm](https://charmhub.io/mysql) can be found in the [mysql-operator repo](https://github.com/canonical/mysql-operator).  Issues should be raised there.
